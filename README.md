## <p>Projects

* [M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](https://github.com/shanmugamm212/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/M5%20Forecasting%20-%20Accuracy.ipynb): Estimated the unit sales of Walmart retail goods. Experimented with Random Forest, Deep neural network - fully connected, RNN for same dataset  
    
* [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/shanmugamm212/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Real%20or%20Not%3F%20NLP%20with%20Disaster%20Tweets.ipynb): Predicted whether the tweets are about **real** disasters or **not**. Used Tranfer learning with AWD LSTM Architecture.

* [University of Liverpool - Ion Switching](https://github.com/shanmugamm212/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/University%20of%20Liverpool%20-%20Ion%20Switching.ipynb): Predicted the number of open ion channels based on electrophysiological signals from human cells. Experimented with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). 

* [Language Model - Tamil](https://github.com/shanmugamm212/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Language%20Model%20-%20Tamil.ipynb): The Pretrained model is readily available for English, So this project will be a pretrained model for Tamil.
