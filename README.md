## <p>Projects

* **[AI4D Malawi News Classification Challenge](https://github.com/shanmugamm212/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/AI4D%20Malawi%20News%20Classification%20Challenge%20(11th%20Place%20Solution))**: Machine learning competition to classify news articles. **Got 11th place (out of 700+ participants)** in private leaderboard (Top 1%).
    * Transfer Learning is used to get the pretrained weights and vocabularies from language model, combined with news article dataset and used AWD LSTM Architecture.
    * Evaluation metric is Accuracy scoring 66%.

* **[GIZ NLP Agricultural Keyword Spotter](https://github.com/shanmugamm212/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/GIZ%20NLP%20Agricultural%20Keyword%20Spotter!%20(14th%20Place%20Solution))**: Machine learning competition to classify audio utterances in Luganda and
English. **Got 14th place (out of 700+ participants)** in private leaderboard (Top 1%).
    * Worked on Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) such as ResNet’s and DenseNet’s.
    * Mean of 5 different models predicted the audio utterances three times better than baseline resnet34 model.
    
* **[University of Liverpool - Ion Switching](https://github.com/shanmugamm212/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/University%20of%20Liverpool%20-%20Ion%20Switching.ipynb)**: Machine Learning project to predict the number of open ion channels based on electrophysiological signals from human cells.
    * Created custom architecture Using Gated Recurrent Unit, Linear layer followed by activation functions.
Further increased accuracy by hyper-parameter tuning.
    * Experimented with Kaiming initialization and used KFold for model selection.
    * The final model predicted the number open channels for a signal with 93.7% accuracy.

* **[M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](https://github.com/shanmugamm212/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/M5%20Forecasting%20-%20Accuracy.ipynb)**: Kaggle project to forecast unit sales of various products sold in USA by
Walmart, in collaboration with University of Nicosia.
    * Experimented with Random Forest, Deep neural network - fully connected, RNN for same dataset.
    * The final model with WRMSSE of 0.75.
    
* **[Language Model - Tamil](https://github.com/shanmugamm212/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Language%20Model%20-%20Tamil.ipynb)**: Machine Learning project to create pretrained language model for the language Tamil.
    * Used Wikipedia Dataset. Trained model with Pytorch framework using FastAI API’s.
    * This model is used to predict the next word by learning from Wikipedia data.
