## <p>Projects

* [M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](https://github.com/JiayuanGuo/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Miniprojects/1.Data_Cleaning_AIrbnb_Listing): Estimated the unit sales of Walmart retail goods. Experimented with Random Forest, Deep neural network - fully connected, RNN for same dataset  
    
* [Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/JiayuanGuo/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Miniprojects/4.Sberbank_Data_Processing): Predicted whether the tweets are about **real** disasters or **not**. Used Tranfer learning with AWD LSTM Architecture.

* [University of Liverpool - Ion Switching](https://github.com/JiayuanGuo/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Miniprojects/2.Web_Crawling_Indeed_Jobs): Predicted the number of open ion channels based on electrophysiological signals from human cells. Experimented with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). 

* [Language Model - Tamil](https://github.com/JiayuanGuo/TrendKeeper): The Pretrained model is readily available for English, So this project will be a pretrained model for Tamil.
